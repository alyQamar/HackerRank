- (Where CITY Not Like 'a%') &rarr; Finds any values that doesn't start with "a"
- (Where CITY Not Like '%a') &rarr; Finds any values that doesn't end with "a"
- '[]' Represents any single character within the brackets and it shortcuts the solution (Overkill) and do same job with 'OR'.
- In this challenge you check if don't start with vowel (i.e. Cairo, Samy) and don't end with vowel (i.e. Aly, Samy) (Meaning don't also contains intersection i.e. hamed).
